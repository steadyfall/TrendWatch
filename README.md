### \* **NOTE** \*
The program is still being made and I am keen on adding new features to this, to make it more versatile and unique.

Plans for the FUTURE : 
- Work on making candlestick charts available
- Create a 'Compare Stocks' option that would extrapolate the graph of prices of different stocks, based on high/low/closing
